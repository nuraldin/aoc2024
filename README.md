Advent of code 2024 challenges repo

I decided to solve the challenges using `rust` language. One step closer into becoming a rustacean.

### How to run the examples

In order to run the examples the easy way you'll need to have `cargo` installed. Then use `cargo run` on the desired folder which contains each challenge of the day.
